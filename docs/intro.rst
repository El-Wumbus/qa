Introduction
============

*quick archival.* is a program that allows for single command compression
and extraction using ``xz``.

| This script compresses an archive of a directory that includes
  information of where the archive should be decompressed. 
  When "unloading" the file with `qa unload` the file will be
  extractd to the directory it was originaly loaded from.
| This could be used for, as an example, dotfile installation.
  
Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

| I made this program in an effort to learn about file
  manipulation and tar archives within python. I also
  did it for fun. This may be used by myself for other
  projects so it seemed like an idea worth exploring if 
  not just for the satisfaction of my curiousity.
