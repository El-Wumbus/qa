*quick archival.* A program that allows for single command compression
and extraction using ``xz``, ``gz``, and ``bz2`` compression

| This script compresses an archive of a directory that includes
  information of where the archive should be decompressed.
| This could be used for, as an example, dotfile installation.
| This is, of course, cross platform. I made this program in an effort
  to learn about file manipulation and working with archives within
  python, as well as a bit of fun.
